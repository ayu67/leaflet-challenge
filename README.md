1. **Get your data set**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. 

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Includes a legend that will provide context for the map data.
